# This file is part of the ePNK project (Petri Net Kernel for eclipse). The ePNK
# is platform for Petri net tools based on the PNML transfer format. Its
# main idea is to provide generic Petri net types which can be easily plugged
# in and a simple generic GMF editor, that can be used for graphically editing
# nets of any plugged in type. Additional functionality can be plugged in.
# 
# Note that this project is still in an experimental phase, and is also used
# as a case study for EMF/GMF based Model-based Software Engineering.
