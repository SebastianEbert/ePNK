
* Serialisation of structural labels to text
  Done (released March 24, 2011)
  
  --

 * Implementation of the Type function for Terms

 * Constraints for HLPNG
    - all ISO/IEC 15909-2 constraints
    - maybe make reference to structure feature to multiplicity 1
      instead of "0..1" (so that not correctly parsed labels are
      reported during validation).
      
  --
  
  once -- which is quite expensive).   
  
  --
  
  * Generic GMF Editor (mostly done)!
  Missing yet:
    - enable multi-line labels for text in LabelProxy and PageLabelProxy
      (in EMF actually)
    - PageLabelProxy content propagation to label
    - propagation for non-structural labels (interface for that)   
    
  More ideas:
    - Make some stuff only readable in the properties views (EMF):
        In LabelProxy and PageLabelProxy:
          - Connected Label
          - Text
    - Cleanup of some names in GMF Editor GUI:
        LabelLink is "Undefined" right now
        LabelProxy and PageLabelProxy should be "Label" and "PageLabel"
        at the end-user front-end
    - Avoid LabelLink completely (by making a tool that directly attaches
      the LabelProxy to an object)

* Nicer icons for the PN elements in EMF edit (Tree-editor and GMF) 
  Mostly done: but the Page, Place, Transition elements of the
               specific net-types also need their own (and maybe
               distinguishable icons)    
     
       
   --    
   
 * Full implementation of HLPNGs (as of ISO/IEC 15909)
   Finished (29.12.2010), but needs some more testing for (List and
   String constructs)
  
   --

 * change the createCommands for all Petri net objects in the
   diagram editor so that an ObjectProxy is added to the 
   tool specific diagram information (if this diagram info
   is present on the resp. page): see
   org.pnml.tools.epnk.diagram.edit.commands
   (The deletion is properly dealt with already).
  
   NOTE: Maybe, it would be better to make LabelProxies a  feature
         of page (only); then we would also avoid using Phantom nodes
         in the GMF editor (important for maintainance)
        
 * Save and reuse the GMF diagram information as tool specific
   information.   
   
 Done 5.-9- may 2011

  * Generic GMF Editor (mostly done)!
   Missing yet:    
    - check: correct dirty bit for modified EMF-files to be sure
             that it is saved, when it there are (relevant)
             changes. Track down the effect which appears to
             be due to two not fully related command stacks.
   More ideas:
    - toolspecific extension for GMF diagram information within PNML
      (including labelproxies and pagelabelproxies for all concerned
       elements)
    - Avoid LabelLink completely (by making a tool that directly attaches
      the LabelProxy to an object) 
  
  Done 
  
  --
  
 * Make sure that when diagram files are edited as PNXD files, the PNX
  is saved properly (switched that of for PNML files, but should be
  on for pnx).
  
  Implemented differently (there are no pnxd files, if PNX is edited,
  the diagram information is saved as toolspecific extension
  
  --  
        
  * make sure that IDs cannot contain blanks! This would (in combination with
    the GMF diagram information) result in files that are not readable anymore.
   
  Done May 2011, the ids are EMF IDs now (which are XMLSchemaIDs, as defined
    in the standard.

   * Proper implementation of data types for CSS values in the graphical model
