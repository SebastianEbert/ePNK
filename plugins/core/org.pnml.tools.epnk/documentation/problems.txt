Known problems and issues
=========================

  9. nov. 2010, eki: 
   "<CNTRL> X" does not work properly: delete elements with
   the popup menu for now!
   
  9. nov. 2010, eki:
   Labels that are not yet linked to a Petri net object will
   show up on ALL newly opened pages. The reason is that 
   LabelProxies are "phantom nodes". Normally the labels
   will be linked right away, so this should not be a
   problem. Eventually, I will implement a way of
   creating labels, so that they are immediately attached
   to a object. Then, this should not be a problem any more.
   For now, I consider this to be a usability issue only
   -- and not an important one. 
   
 13. nov. 2010, eki:
   Validation of correct ArcAnnotation does not work yet, if
   the arc is connected to reference place (for this we need
   to implement a resolution of the reference).
   


Resolved problems and issues
============================
   
 13. nov. 2010, eki:
   If a node is deleted in the GMF editor, the labels are not
   deleted with it (which results in a problem later, since
   these labels cannot be deleted anymore -- but the will
   not exist anymore, when the editor is started again).
   Anyway, this needs to be fixed.
   Fixed partially: 17. 11. 2010, eki (the follow up problem
         was resolved; deleting the labels with the object
         resulted in some other errors).
   
 18. nov. 2010, eki:
   Undo of deletion of arcs does not work properly. The reason
   seems to be that the phantom labels are removed together
   with the arcs (similar to the reason why the full fix
   of 17. nov. was not possible).
   Fixed: 19.11.2010, eki: The reason was, that the method
          getDestroyArcCommand in the ArcItemSemanticEditPolicy 
          did not take the ObjectLabelProxyLinks into account
          (I do not have any idea why; it seems that phantom
          nodes are not meant to be attached to Links). Fixed
          that; actually, this needed even be done for Nodes
          that delete the associated arc.
