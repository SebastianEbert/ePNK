Ideas and features for future versions
======================================

October 2012:
  - Application registration with a configurable view
    that shows the available applications (possibly filtered
    by applicable net type, and user criteria, and structured
    into definable categories or according to net types).
    For that applications would need to be explicitly plugin
    in together with some additional information (net types,
    it applies to, extra parameters, etc.)
    
    This application view could also have fields for entering
    input to the application before it is started.
    
  - Feature that adds all possible labels of an object automatically
    (e.g. on a double click) or that adds a specific kind of
    label (selected by the user) if there are labels already.
    
  - Feedback on parsing errors of structured labels (by a
    extra tool specific information and by allowing the
    parsing function to return an error object instead of null).
    This also needs to be adjusted with the serialisation
    function (delete the respective tool information when
    serializing the labels to their text).
