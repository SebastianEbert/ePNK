The Model Checking in Education Project
---------------------------------------

In order to experiment with the model checker, this directory
provides some example file of systems and properties. Currently,
there are two kinds of system representations implemented:

  * fair Kripke structures and
  * fair transition systems

To run the model checker you need a Java Runtime Environment to
be installed on your system (the model checker was tested on
j2re1.4.2_01; but, it should work on other versions too).

In order to start the model checkers, you can use the batch
files in this directory.

On a Windows platform, you can start the model checker for fair
Kripke structures with the following command from a command
shell from this directory 

  > MC system props
  
On a Unix or Linux platform, it might be necessary to make the
file MC executabel before, and it might be necessary to prefix
the command MC with './' as shown below
 
  > ./MC system props

The model checker for fair transition systems can be started with
the commands

  > MCTS system props
  
or

  > ./MCTS system props  
    
For a documentation of the syntax of fair Kripke structures, fair
transition systems, and the properties, see the documentation of the
source code (JavaDoc).
