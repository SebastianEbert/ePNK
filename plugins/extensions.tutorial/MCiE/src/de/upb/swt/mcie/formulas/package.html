  This package implements formulas, which can be state formulas, transition formulas
  or temporal formulas. Note that this is not a disjoint classification, because
  state formulas are also temporal formulas and transition formulas. A formula is
  a state formula, if there are no temporal operators and primed variables in it.
  A formula is a transition formula, if there are no temporal operators in it.
  A formula is a temporal formula, if there are no primed variables in it.
  
  In most cases it does not make sense to have temporal operators as well as
  primed variables in a formula. But, they are not forbidden and can be used
  with benefit in some special cases.
  
  Formulas consist of unary and binary operations, which are the inner nodes,
  and of variables and constants as leaf nodes.  The different operators as
  well as their binding priorities (which is necessary for parsing them) are defined as
  constants in the two classes {@link de.upb.swt.mcie.formulas.UnaryOp UnaryOp} and
  {@link de.upb.swt.mcie.formulas.BinaryOp BinaryOp}.  Also
  there is a table indicating for each operator whether it is a temporal operator
  or not.  This makes it easy to extend formulas by new operations.
