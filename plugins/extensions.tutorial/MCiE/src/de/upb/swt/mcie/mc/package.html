  This package implements models with the corresponding model checking
  procedures, and the main method for invoking the model checker.
  Special model are Kripke structures and transition systems as well
  their fair extensions.<p>
  
  The model checking procedures use the methods for operations on ROBDDs
  implemented in the package {@link de.upb.swt.mcie.robdds}.
