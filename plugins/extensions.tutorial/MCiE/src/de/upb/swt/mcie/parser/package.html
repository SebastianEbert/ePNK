  This package implements a parser and compiler for formulas and models. It parses
  a given text from some {@link java.io.Reader Reader} and, if syntactically correct,
  returns the internal representation of this {@link de.upb.swt.mcie.formulas.Formula
  Formula} or {@link de.upb.swt.mcie.mc.Model Model}.<p>
  
  The formula can be a state formulas, a transition formulas, or a temporal formula.
  A state formula does not contain temporal operators and no primed variables. A
  transition formula must not contain temporal operators, but may contain primed
  variables. A temporal formula may contain temporal operators (CTL operators), but
  must not contain primed variables (see {@link de.upb.swt.mcie.formulas.Formula} for
  details). <p>
  
  Concerning models, there are methods for parsing
  {@link de.upb.swt.mcie.mc.Kripkestructure Kripkestructures} and
  {@link de.upb.swt.mcie.mc.Transitionsystem Transitionsystems} as well as
  the fair versions of them.<p>
  
  The parser is defined in a generic way such that it is easy to extend formulas
  with new unary and binary operations.  In particular, the binding priority of
  all operators is defined in the classes {@link de.upb.swt.mcie.formulas.BinaryOp} and
  {@link de.upb.swt.mcie.formulas.UnaryOp}.  Also the information, which operators are
  temporal operators is not known to the parser.  The lexical representation of
  the operations is defined in the class {@link de.upb.swt.mcie.parser.Scanner}.
  The only information encoded directly into the parser is that all binary operators
  associate from the left to the right; for example, the formula
  a<sub>1</sub> &amp; a<sub>2</sub> &amp; a<sub>3</sub> &amp;... &amp; a<sub>n</sub>
  is parsed in the following way
  ((... ((a<sub>1</sub> &amp; a<sub>2</sub>) &amp; a<sub>3</sub>) &amp; ... )
     &amp; a<sub>n</sub> ).
  Moreover, the parser resp. the scanner defines legal brackets. Currently, there
  are parenthesis and square brackets, which must be properly matched.   But,
  there is no other meaning in the different brackets.  The use of different
  brackets should help to make formulas more readable.
  <p>
  
  Note that the binary CTL-formulas are represented as a single operator. So
  an until formula reads f EU g instead of E[ f U g ].<p>
    
  The parser is a simple recursive descend procedure with one token look ahead.
  To be more precise, the parser may return the last token to the scanner
  (see method {@link de.upb.swt.mcie.parser.Scanner#revert() revert} of class
  {@link de.upb.swt.mcie.parser.Scanner}).
  The tokens returned by the scanner are provided in the package
  {@link de.upb.swt.mcie.parser.token}.<p>
  
  Within the text the scanner will ignore the rest of a line, when it encounters
  the symbol #.  So, # indicates a line comment.
