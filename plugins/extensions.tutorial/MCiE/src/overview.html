  The purpose of the Model Checking in Education (MCiE) project
  is to demonstrate the implementation
  of a symbolic model checker based on ROBDDs. It was implemented by
  <a href="http://www.upb.de/cs/kindler">Ekkart Kindler</a> as supplementary
  material for the students of the course on
  <a href="http://www.upb.de/cs/kindler/Lehre/WS03/MC/">model checking</a>
  in the winter term 2003/04 at
  <a href="http://www.upb.de/">Paderborn University</a>.<p>
  
  Since this first course, MCiE has been extended and improved when
  used in other projects and during the course "Advanced Topics on
  Software Engineering" at Technical University of Denmark.<p>
  
  Since the main purpose of this application was educational, it is not
  particularly tuned to efficiency, but for a clear structure and a safe
  usability of the libraries.  At some places in the code, comments indicate
  what could be done for improving efficiency - apart from using a compiled
  programming language such as C instead of Java.<p>
  
  <h3>Release notes</h3>
  <ul>
  <li>
  Version 0.1.0: The first version of MCiE publicly released.
  Note that the procedures for computing the relation product are
  not carefully tested yet.<p>
  
  <li>
  Version 0.2.0: Class {@link de.upb.swt.mcie.robdds.Context Context} has been
  introduced. Now, all ROBDDs are generated in such a context, in
  which the involved variables and all corresponding hash tables are
  maintained. This makes it easier to work with different variable sets
  with different variable orders at the same time. Moreover, it is easier to
  get rid of old nodes and variables: simply delete all references to
  the context. As soon as all references to a context (and to ROBDDs from
  this context) are deleted, all memory used for this context will be claimed
  by the garbage collector fully automatically. Moreover, the hash tables of
  each context can be cleared individually
  (see {@link de.upb.swt.mcie.robdds.Context#clearHashTables()
  clearHashTables()}). <p>
  
  Note that now all operations on ROBDDs
  may only be applied to ROBDDs from the same context; otherwise a
  corresponding {@link de.upb.swt.mcie.robdds.IncorrectUseException
  IncorrectUseException} will be thrown. Due to the introduction of the
  context, the classes {@link de.upb.swt.mcie.mc.Model Model} and
  {@link de.upb.swt.mcie.formulas.Formula Formula} had to be revised
  too. Each model is now associated with a context. A formula, however,
  does not need to know its context. Only when converting a formula to an
  ROBDD, the context must be provided. The context can be
  either given implicitly via the model
  ({@link de.upb.swt.mcie.formulas.Formula#toROBDD(de.upb.swt.mcie.mc.Model)
  toROBDD(Model)} for temporal formulas) or by an explicit parameter
  when calling the method
  {@link de.upb.swt.mcie.formulas.Formula#toROBDD(Context) toROBDD(Context)}.
  
  <li>
  Version 0.3.1:  The methods
  {@link de.upb.swt.mcie.robdds.ROBDD#successors(de.upb.swt.mcie.robdds.ROBDD)
  successor(ROBDD)} of version 0.2.x contained some errors, which are now
  corrected.<p>
  
  Moreover, the class {@link de.upb.swt.mcie.robdds.ChangeSet} and the method
  {@link de.upb.swt.mcie.robdds.ROBDD#predecessors(
  de.upb.swt.mcie.robdds.ROBDD, de.upb.swt.mcie.robdds.ChangeSet)
  predecessors(ROBDD,ChangeSet)} have been added. This way, the variables that
  are not changed by a transition relation need not be explicitly mentioned in
  the ROBDD, which significantly reduces the size of the corresponding ROBDD
  and the time needed for calculating the predecessors.
  
  <li>
  Version 0.3.2:  In order to show the application of the predecessor methods
  with a changeset, the class {@link de.upb.swt.mcie.mc.Transitionsystem
  Transitionsystem} was introduced, which uses a partitioned transition
  relation. This results in a more efficient implementation of the ex method
  and altogether in more efficient model checking routines.<p>
  
  Moreover, the class {@link de.upb.swt.mcie.robdds.ChangeSet ChangeSet} was
  equipped with methods for adding variables individually and a method for
  clearing its hash tables. In addition, class
  {@link de.upb.swt.mcie.formulas.Formula Formula} was equipped with a method
  adding all variables that occur primed in a formula to a given change set.
  This way, it is easier to calculate the appropriate change sets of a
  transition formula.<p>
  
  Moreover, the method
  {@link de.upb.swt.mcie.robdds.ROBDD#successors(
  de.upb.swt.mcie.robdds.ROBDD, de.upb.swt.mcie.robdds.ChangeSet)
  successors(ROBDD,ChangeSet)} are implemented now, which can be used for a more
  efficient calculation of the reachable states. 

  <li>
  Version 0.3.3, December 13, 2004:  The class {@link de.upb.swt.mcie.mc.FairModel FairModel}
  implements the procedures for fair model checking. These methods work
  for any model (with correctly implemented model checking procedures). So
  MCiE supports fair model checking for all implemented models including
  Kripke structures and fair transition systems.  In order to make this work,
  the structure of {@link de.upb.swt.mcie.mc.Model Model},
  {@link de.upb.swt.mcie.mc.Kripkestructure Kripkestructure}, and
   {@link de.upb.swt.mcie.mc.Transitionsystem Transitionsystem} had to be
   slightly changed (fairness conditions are no longer included there).<p> 
   
  <li>
  Version 0.3.4, March 8, 2006: The model checkers print a warning now, when the list of
  properties could not be read to end because of a syntax error. All properties
  up to this point will be checked anyway.<p>
  
  <li>
  Version 0.3.5, March 19, 2009: Project deployed as an eclipse plugin. Removed some typos in
  comments and documentation.<p>
  
  Corrected a problem with the parser: The scanner returned the literals "and" and "or"
  as unary operators. Therefore, formulas using these textual operators could not be
  parsed properly. This problem is fixed now.<p>
  
  Added toString() method for formulas to convert formulas to strings
  in a naive way (with many parentheses).<p>
  
  <li>
  Version 0.3.6, April 6, 2010: Changed string representation (introduced
  in version 0.3.5) of the AND-operator to '&amp;&amp;', since a single '&amp;' is
  interpreted as the definition of a mnemonic in eclipse dialogs;
  doubling it escapes this 'eclipse feature'.<p>
  
  <li>
  Version 0.3.7, December 1, 2010: Introduced a mechanism to abort a model checking
  operation on a model from a different thread and suppressed some warnings (due
  to MCiE not using generics).<p>
  
  <li>
  Version 0.3.8, November 1, 2012: Added some more checks for aborting the 
  model checking on Transition systems (inside the ex and computeReachable method). 
  To this end, added a checkAbort() method to the Model, which can be called 
  from sub classes in longer running computations.<p>
  
  <li>
  Version 0.3.9, June 30, 2017: Changed serialization of formulas (toString() method),
  so that the constants are shown as true and false instead of (1 and 0).
