This project is an experimental extension of the ePNK project
(Petri Net Kernel for eclipse). The ePNK is platform for Petri
net tools based on the PNML transfer format. Its main idea is to
provide generic Petri net types which can be easily plugged in
and a simple generic GMF editor, that can be used for graphically editing
nets of any plugged in type. Additional functionality can be plugged in.

<h3>Purpose</h3>

The objective of this experimental project is a generic parsing and
serialisation technology that could be used for parsing and serialising
the textual labels of structured labels in new Petri net types. The
reason is that Xtext is very nice for implementing parser, but not
very good at the reverse direction.<p>  

This project experiments with some rules that could be used for parsing
and serialising the structural labels. Right now the focus is more on
the serialisation and the the example for that are HLPNGs.<p>

The current version seems to work fine for serialising all HLPNG
labels. Since this is a very important functionality (PNML nets
could come without any tectual labels or labels quite different
ones from the ePNK), we release this experimental plugin, in spite
of it being a bit raw, having strange names and packages are not
being qualified (which almost certainly will change in the future).<p>
